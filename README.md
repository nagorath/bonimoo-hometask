Q: How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

A: I tried to think what will happen if this app will get bigger.
now it's a small app with two pages and very simple functionallity.
I tried to plan it in a way that if tommorow there will be more pages, or more info to show you could reuse all the componenets again with no problem and no need in restructure.

Q: Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

A: I feel that being an Angular programmer and doing an excrecise in React im pretty satisfied with the results as i had to learn few concepts throughout the excrecise.

Q: What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

A: Better responsive version.
